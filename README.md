# 10/27-navigation-interceptor-nextjs

This project is all about creating a navigation interceptor in Next.js.

I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to initiate the project and
will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and for styling
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).
